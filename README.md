# CPP Modules Project: C++ and OOP Concepts Mastery

## Overview
The CPP Modules project is a comprehensive series of nine modules, from CPP Module 00 to CPP Module 09, designed to provide participants with a strong understanding of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The project covers a wide range of topics, from basic class and object overloading to advanced concepts like the Standard Template Library (STL) containers.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the CPP Modules project is to equip participants with a solid foundation in C++ programming and Object-Oriented Programming. By completing these modules, you will gain a deep understanding of the language and its core concepts, which will enable you to write efficient, maintainable, and scalable C++ code.

## Key Learning Objectives
The CPP Modules project aims to achieve the following key learning objectives:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| CPP Module 00 | Introduction to C++ and basic program structure. |
| CPP Module 01 | Memory allocation, references, and pointers. |
| CPP Module 02 | Ad-hoc polymorphism with function overloading and operator overloading. |
| CPP Module 03 | Inheritance, encapsulation, and dynamic polymorphism (virtual functions). |
| CPP Module 04 | Subtype polymorphism with abstract classes and interfaces. |
| CPP Module 05 | Exception handling and error management in C++. |
| CPP Module 06 | Type casting and explicit conversions in C++. |
| CPP Module 07 | Template programming and generic algorithms. |
| CPP Module 08 | Advanced C++ concepts, such as namespaces, lambdas, and smart pointers. |
| CPP Module 09 | Deep dive into the Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms. |

## Project Scope
Each CPP module will cover specific aspects of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming, building upon the concepts from previous modules. The project scope includes:

| Module | Topics |
|--------|--------|
| CPP Module 00 | - Introduction to C++<br>- Basic I/O and program structure |
| CPP Module 01 | - Memory allocation in C++<br>- References and pointers.<br>- Const-correctness in C++. |
| CPP Module 02 | - Ad-hoc polymorphism with function overloading.<br>- Operator overloading.<br>- Operator overloading as member functions vs. global functions. |
| CPP Module 03 | - Inheritance and its types (single, multiple, and virtual inheritance).<br>- Polymorphism and virtual functions.<br>- Upcasting and downcasting. |
| CPP Module 04 | - Abstract classes and pure virtual functions.<br>- Interfaces and their usage in C++. |
| CPP Module 05 | - Handling exceptions in C++.<br>- Throwing and catching exceptions.<br>- Best practices for exception handling. |
| CPP Module 06 | - Type casting in C++ (dynamic_cast, static_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast).<br>- Explicit conversions with constructors and explicit keyword. |
| CPP Module 07 | - Introduction to template programming in C++.<br>- Function templates and class templates.<br>- Generic algorithms with STL algorithms. |
| CPP Module 08 | - Namespaces in C++ and their usage.<br>- Lambda expressions and closures.<br>- Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr). |
| CPP Module 09 | - Comprehensive overview of STL containers (vector, list, map, etc.).<br>- STL algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating containers.<br>- Choosing the right container for specific use cases. |

## Getting Started
To begin the CPP Modules project, ensure you have a C++ development environment set up on your system. Familiarize yourself with the basics of C++ programming, as the project will build upon these foundations. Each module will come with specific instructions and exercises to complete.


## Conclusion
The CPP Modules project is an excellent opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. Mastering these concepts will empower you to build robust and efficient C++ applications, handle complex data structures, and leverage the power of the Standard Template Library.

Best of luck with your CPP Modules journey! Happy coding in C++! ðŸš€
